## OPEN TELEMETRY - Nicolas Frankel

**Introduction:**

In the landscape of modern software development, monitoring and observing distributed systems have become increasingly challenging. OpenTelemetry emerges as a solution to enhance observability, providing insights into system behavior through metrics, logging, and tracing.

**1. Understanding Observability:**

- **Evolution from Monitoring to Observability:**
  - Traditional monitoring involved reactive approaches, waiting for errors to surface.
  - Observability encompasses metrics, logging, and tracing, offering proactive data collection and analysis capabilities.

**2. The Three Pillars of Observability:**

- **Metrics:**
  - Ranging from system-level metrics like CPU and memory to higher-level metrics such as requests per second and HTTP status codes.
  - Essential for understanding system performance and behavior.

- **Logging:**
  - Key considerations include determining what to log, logging format, and where to log (console, files).
  - Emphasizes the importance of centralized logging systems for effective aggregation and analysis.

- **Tracing:**
  - Facilitates tracking a request's journey across multiple components.
  - Concepts of trace (request path across components) and span (bound to a single component) are crucial for comprehensive tracing.

**3. Introduction to OpenTelemetry:**

- **Defining OpenTelemetry:**
  - OpenTelemetry standardizes formats and protocols for telemetry data transmission.
  - Offers two approaches for instrumentation: auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation.

- **Auto-Instrumentation:**
  - Benefits include low coupling, ease of implementation, and cost-effectiveness.
  - Utilizes runtime instrumentation to capture telemetry data without direct intervention.

- **Manual Instrumentation:**
  - Requires integrating OpenTelemetry libraries and APIs into the codebase.
  - Offers greater control and flexibility but comes with increased complexity and dependency management.

**Conclusion:**

OpenTelemetry serves as a powerful toolset for enhancing observability in distributed systems. By leveraging metrics, logging, and tracing capabilities, teams can gain valuable insights into system performance, diagnose issues effectively, and ensure the reliability and scalability of their applications in today's complex environments.
