## Technical Debt Warrior or: Everybody  hates you - Philippe Trepanier

Introduction:

Technical debt is the accumulated cost of shortcuts and compromises made during software development. Like an iceberg, much of it remains hidden beneath the surface, often leading to unforeseen consequences.

1. Origins of Technical Debt:

Forced Features: Pressure from project managers, negligence from previous developers, or lack of seniority can lead to rushed decisions and the accumulation of technical debt.
Result: A looming "big bag" of technical debt that threatens the project's stability and future.

2. The Debt Spectrum:

Good Debt vs. Bad Debt:
Good debt: Strategic decisions like acquiring another company to unify functionalities.
Bad debt: Rushed fixes, accumulating inefficiencies, and poor decision-making.
Transformation: Good debt can deteriorate into bad debt over time if not managed properly.

3. Managing Technical Debt:

Incremental Approach:
Tackle technical debt gradually, allocating a small portion of resources (e.g., 10%) to address it over time.
Involve business stakeholders to prioritize and understand the importance of addressing technical debt.

4. Recognizing Bad Debt:

Signs of Escalation:
From manageable to uncontrollable, bad debt manifests as a cascade of problems, leading to demotivation and blame games.
Stakeholders may remain unaware until the situation reaches a critical point.

5. Mitigation Strategies:

Project Management Role:
Project managers play a crucial role in stabilizing the project, ensuring continuity, and facilitating necessary technical work.
Responsibilities include identifying, prioritizing, and allocating resources for technical debt management.

6. Collaboration and Accountability:

Team Dynamics:
Encourage a culture of accountability during retrospectives, where team members take responsibility for addressing technical debt.
Foster collaboration by transferring responsibility for neglected tasks to relevant team members.

7. Development Practices:

Defensive Programming:
Implement defensive programming practices to ensure code robustness and resilience.
Prioritize thorough checks and validations to prevent errors and minimize technical debt accumulation.

Conclusion:

Addressing technical debt is vital for the long-term success of software projects. By acknowledging its existence, implementing proactive management strategies, and fostering a culture of collaboration and accountability, teams can navigate the hidden depths of technical debt and ensure the stability and sustainability of their projects.
